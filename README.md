A curated library of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/BankrBot/openclaw-skills) skills approved and recommended by MetaMask developers. This repository serves as a trusted collection of AI agent skills for building, testing, and interacting with MetaMask and the broader Ethereum ecosystem.

## What are OpenClaw Skills?
