# Example Provider

This directory contains example skills to demonstrate the expected repository structure.

**Do not use these skills directly** — they are for reference only.

## Structure

```
_example/
└── sample-skill/
    ├── SKILL.md           # Main skill definition
    └── references/        # Supporting documentation
        └── api-reference.md
```

When creating your own skill, follow this structure under your provider directory.
